BlogApplication
The application is API First so swagger has been created then the code driven from it 
For the app to work u need to run Maven Clean Install to generate needed classes
Also need Junit 5 in the build path to run the test
The application runs on java 11
U can run the app by running BlogApplication.java
The exception handle should be better, but I did not have time
Also, I could do more unit test specially on data layer
the carepay-ms-blog.yaml in src\main\resources\api u need it to test for example add it in soapui will create the request u can also view it better by cope the content in https://editor.swagger.io/
